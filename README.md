## üé¨ Getting Started with the Examples

The executable examples are designed to be imported into the SAP BTP ABAP environment, but they are basically suitable for both on-premise systems (ABAP release >= 7.56; especially the RAP examples) and the SAP BTP ABAP environment (hence there are no ABAP reports included). Therefore, check the information in the following collapsible sections for your system environment and perform the required steps.

<details>
  <summary>1) General info</summary>
  <br>

- Some **DDIC artifacts**, such as database tables, are part of the repository. They are used by the examples to ensure self-contained examples. All artifacts must be imported for all examples to work.
- All examples are designed to **display some output in the ADT console**. Once successfully imported, you can **run** the examples in ADT by choosing `F9` to display the output in the ADT console.
- The examples **include descriptions and comments** in the code to provide explanations and set the context.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>2a) SAP BTP ABAP environment</summary>
  <br>

**Prerequisites**
- [x] You have access to an SAP BTP ABAP Environment instance (see [here](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/09/04/sap-cloud-platform-abap-environment) for additional information).
- [x] You have downloaded and installed the ABAP Development Tools (ADT). Make sure that you are using the latest version, as indicated on the [installation page](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#abap).
- [x] Before importing the code, you have performed a system-wide search for classes named `ZCL_DEMO_ABAP*`, for example, so that you do not run into errors when you try to import the code. If someone has already imported the content into the system, you can simply check out that imported version and proceed to the step *3) Run the code*.
- [x] You have created an ABAP cloud project in ADT that allows you to access your SAP BTP ABAP Environment instance (see [here](https://help.sap.com/viewer/5371047f1273405bb46725a417f95433/Cloud/en-US/99cc54393e4c4e77a5b7f05567d4d14c.html) for more information). Your login language is English.
- [x] You have installed the [abapGit](https://github.com/abapGit/eclipse.abapgit.org) plug-in for ADT from the [update site](http://eclipse.abapgit.org/updatesite/).



**Import Code**

Use the abapGit plug-in to install the <em>ABAP Cheat Sheets</em> by carrying out the following steps:

1. In your ABAP cloud project, create a package, for example, `ZABAP_CHEAT_SHEETS` as the target package. It is recommended that you assign the package to a transport request that is suitable for demo content.
2. Add the package to the *Favorite Packages* in the *Project Explorer* view in ADT.
3. To add the <em>abapGit Repositories</em> view to the <em>ABAP</em> perspective, choose `Window` ‚Üí `Show View` ‚Üí `Other...` from the menu bar and choose `abapGit Repositories`.
4. In the <em>abapGit Repositories</em> view, click the `+` icon in the upper right corner of the ADT tab to link a new abapGit repository.
  <br>![ADT](./files/abapGit_Repositories.png)

5. The *Link abapGit Repository* popup appears. Enter the following URL:

```
https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-cheat-sheets.git
```

6. Choose `Next`.

7. On the *Branch and Package Selection* screen, enter the name of the created package (for example, `ZABAP_CHEAT_SHEETS`) in the `Package` field.
8. Choose `Next`.
9.  On the *Select Transport Request* screen, select the created transport request that is suitable for the demo content and choose `Finish` to link the Git repository to your ABAP cloud project. If the created package is already assigned to a transport request for the demo content, and a message appears that an object is already locked in a transport request, choose `Finish`, too.
10. In the *abapGit Repositories* view, filter for your package. The repository appears in the *abapGit Repositories* view with the status <em>Linked</em>.
11. Right-click on the new abapGit repository and choose `Pull...` to start the cloning of the repository contents.
12. On the *Branch and Package Selection* screen, choose `Next`.
13. If the *Locally Modified Object* screen is displayed, select the objects (for example, the package to automatically select all artifacts) from the list and choose `Next`.
14. On the next screen, select a transport request and choose `Finish`. Same as above, if an *object already locked* message is displayed, choose `Finish` as well. The status in the *abapGit Repositories* view changes to <em>Pull running...</em>. Note that the pull run may take several minutes.
15. Once the cloning is complete, the status changes to `Pulled Successfully`. You may need to refresh the `abapGit Repositories` view to see the progress of the import. To do this, choose the  `Refresh` icon in the upper right corner of the view.
16. Refresh your project tree. For example, in ADT, right-click the package and choose `Refresh` or `F5`. The package should contain all the artifacts from the GitHub repository.
17. Make sure that all artifacts are active. To activate all inactive development objects, choose the `Activate all inactive ABAP development objects` button from the menu (or choose `CTRL+Shift+F3`).

  <summary>2b) Application Server ABAP On-Premise</summary>
<br>

**Prerequisites**
- [x] It is assumed that you are running the latest [ABAP release](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abennews-75.htm). Note that the RAP examples, for example, require at least ABAP version 7.56.
- [x] Before importing the code, you have performed a system-wide search for classes named `ZCL_DEMO_ABAP*`, for example, to avoid errors when you try to import the code. If someone has already imported the content into the system, you can simply check out that imported version and proceed to the step *3) Run the code*.
- [x] You have downloaded and installed the ABAP Development Tools (ADT). Make sure that you are using the latest version, as indicated on the [installation page](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#abap).
- [x] You have created an ABAP project in ADT that allows you to access your application server as mentioned above. Your login language is English.
- [x] You have downloaded and installed the standalone version of the abapGit report. Make sure you are using the latest version, as indicated on the [installation page](https://docs.abapgit.org/). You can create a report, for example, `zabapgit_standalone`, and copy and paste [this code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abapGit/build/main/zabapgit_standalone.prog.abap) into the program.

**Import Code**

Use the standalone version of the abapGit report to import the demo examples of the ABAP cheat sheets by performing the following steps:
1. In your ABAP project, create a package, such as `TEST_ABAP_CHEAT_SHEETS` as a target package suitable for demo content (for example, by using `LOCAL` as the software component).
2. Add the package to the *Favorite Packages* in the *Project Explorer* view in ADT.
3. Run the standalone version of the abapGit report.
4. Choose the `New Online` button. If the button is not available, for example, if another repository is already open, choose the `Repository List` button.
5. On the *New Online Repository* screen, make the following entries:
   - `Git Repository URL`:

      ```
      https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-cheat-sheets.git
      ```

   - `Package`: Your demo package, for example, `TEST_ABAP_CHEAT_SHEETS`
6. Leave the other fields unchanged and choose `Create Online Repo`.
7. The *Repository* screen displays the available ABAP artifacts to be imported into your ABAP system.
8.  Choose the `Pull` button. The import of the artifacts is triggered. This may take several minutes.
9. If the `Inactive Objects` popup is displayed, select all artifacts and choose `Continue` (‚úîÔ∏è).
10.	When the cloning is complete, refresh your project tree. For example, in ADT, right-click on the package and choose `Refresh` or `F5`. The package should contain all artifacts from the GitHub repository.
11. Make sure that all artifacts are active. To activate all inactive development objects, choose the `Activate all inactive ABAP development objects` button from the menu (or choose `CTRL+Shift+F3`).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>3) Run the code</summary>
<br>

- Open the package you created containing the imported ABAP artifacts in the ABAP Development Tools (ADT).
- Open one of the ABAP cheat sheet example classes listed in the [ABAP Cheat Sheets Overview](#-abap-cheat-sheets-overview) section, for example, `zcl_demo_abap_string_proc`. The classes are located in the `Source Code Library` ‚Üí `Classes` folder.
- Choose `F9` to run the class. Alternatively, choose `Run` ‚Üí `Run As` ‚Üí `2 ABAP Application (Console)` from the menu.
- Check the console output.

> **üí° Note**<br>
>- Check the notes on the context and the ABAP syntax used that are included as comments in the class.
>- Due to the amount of output in the console, the examples include numbers (e.g. 1) ..., 2) ..., 3) ...) that represent the headers of each example code section. Also, in most cases, the variable name is displayed in the console. Therefore, to find the relevant output in the console more easily and quickly, simply search the console for the number (e.g. search for `3)` for the particular output) or variable name (`CTRL+F` in the console), or use breakpoints in the code to check variables in the debugger.
>- You may want to clear the console by right-clicking in the console and choosing `Clear` before running another demo class to avoid confusing the output of multiple classes.
</details>

<br>

## ‚ö° Known Issues
- Only one user on the system can import this repository because all object names must be globally unique. Before importing the code, you should perform a system-wide search for classes named `ZCL_DEMO_ABAP*`, for example. If someone has already imported the content into the system, you can simply check out that imported code.
- Since the repository contains self-contained examples, i.e. some of them work with demo database tables included in the repository (note that these tables are populated during method executions), all demo artifacts must be imported for all examples to work.
- When importing into an on-premise system, note the following: The demos cover ABAP syntax regardless of the ABAP release to avoid scattering information and to have the information in one go. Therefore and if you are not running the latest ABAP version, there may be syntax that is not yet available in the ABAP version of your on-premise system. In this case, you may want to comment out the affected code sections or ignore the affected artifacts if an activation fails. Note that the RAP examples in particular require at least ABAP version 7.56. 
- Regarding possible code check warnings, e.g. for the many strings in the code, not using an `ORDER BY` clause, or messages regarding using `SELECT *`, the code deliberately avoids [pragmas](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenpragma_glosry.htm) and [pseudo comments](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenpseudo_comment_glosry.htm) in order to focus on the available ABAP syntax. See also the [Disclaimer](#%EF%B8%8F-disclaimer).
